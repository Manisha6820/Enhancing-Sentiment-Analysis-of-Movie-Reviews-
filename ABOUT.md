About â€” Comparative Study of Sentiment Classification Models on IMDb Reviews

This repository contains a capstone research project that benchmarks classical machine learning and deep learning models for binary sentiment classification on the IMDb 50k dataset.

Purpose:
- Provide reproducible benchmarks comparing model accuracy and operational efficiency (training time & inference latency).
- Serve as a showcase project for campus placements and open-source contributions.
- Provide clear instructions for extending the benchmark with new models.

What you'll find here:
- Reproducible scripts for preprocessing, training, evaluating, and comparing models.
- Implementations of SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, k-NN (TF-IDF pipeline).
- Implementations of CNN, LSTM, GRU, RNN (tokenization + embeddings).
- Scripts to log metrics and export result tables and plots.

Audience:
- Students and researchers looking for a reproducible benchmark.
- Engineers needing a starting point for CPU-friendly text classification deployments.
- Recruiters and interviewers evaluating ML project structure, experiment rigor, and reproducibility.
